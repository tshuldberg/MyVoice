### Above the Fold

**Headline (Option A):**  
Private dictation for Mac that never sends your voice to the cloud.

**Subheadline:**  
Double-tap `fn`, speak naturally, and your words appear in the app you are already using. Free, open source, and built for people who want control over their data.

**Primary CTA:**  
Download MyVoice for macOS

**Secondary CTA:**  
See How It Works

### Social Proof / Credibility

- Open source (MIT)  
- Free forever  
- No account required  
- On-device transcription with whisper.cpp

### Problem

Most dictation tools force a tradeoff: convenience or privacy.  
Cloud-based products can be accurate, but they require trust, accounts, and often monthly fees.  
Built-in dictation can be limiting for people who dictate throughout the day.

### Solution

MyVoice gives you a simple dictation workflow without cloud transcription:

- Start dictation with a double-tap of `fn`  
- Speak naturally while a lightweight overlay shows status  
- Auto-stop on silence and type directly into your focused text field

No copy/paste workflow. No prompt writing. No extra editor.

### Benefits

**Keep your data local**  
Speech is transcribed on your Mac with whisper.cpp.

**Use it anywhere you type**  
Works across everyday macOS apps and editors.

**Pay nothing**  
MyVoice is free forever with no subscription tiers.

**Inspect the code**  
The project is open source under MIT.

### How It Works

1. Download and install MyVoice from Releases.  
2. Launch once and complete one-time setup (dependency + model download).  
3. Grant Microphone and Accessibility permissions.  
4. Double-tap `fn` and start dictating.

### Objection Handling

**"Does this upload my voice?"**  
No. Transcription runs on-device with whisper.cpp.

**"Do I need an account?"**  
No account, no login, no subscription.

**"Is it offline?"**  
After one-time setup, dictation works without an internet connection.

## Alternatives

### Headline Alternatives

- **Option B:** Dictate anywhere on macOS without accounts, subscriptions, or cloud transcription.  
Rationale: Emphasizes friction/cost reduction.

- **Option C:** Double-tap `fn` and dictate with privacy-first voice typing on Mac.  
Rationale: Leads with interaction model and product behavior.

### CTA Alternatives

## Annotations

- Headline is explicit, not clever, to maximize first-read clarity.
- Subheadline combines behavior ("double-tap fn") with positioning (free, open source, privacy-first).
- Social proof uses trust primitives available now (open source, no account, free).
- Benefits are outcome-first and mapped to known product facts.
- Objection section addresses the 3 highest-friction pre-install concerns.
- Final CTA repeats core value proposition before the action prompt.
